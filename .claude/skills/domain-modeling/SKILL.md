# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline — challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise. (Merely *reading* `CONTEXT.md` for vocabulary is not this skill — that's a one-line habit any skill can do. This skill is for when you're changing the model, not just consuming it.)

`CONTEXT.md` and the ADRs are written **only** in a grilling session — `build-factory` context mode (the project-context bootstrap) or `grill-with-docs` (per story). Those are the only writers that add or amend; `/clean-context` prunes (deletes and tightens, never adds — ADR-0005); every other flow reads them. This skill is how a grilling session does that writing.

## File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── CONTEXT.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily — only when you have something to write. If no `CONTEXT.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `CONTEXT.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y — which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account' — do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible — which is right?"

### Update CONTEXT.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `CONTEXT.md` right there. Don't batch these up — capture them as they happen. Use the format in [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](./CONTEXT-FORMAT.md).

`CONTEXT.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details — never a spec, a scratch pad, a changelog, or a home for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else; an entry that needs the full contract points to the ADR that fixed it rather than inlining it.

### Offer ADRs against the named counterfactual

Only offer to create an ADR when you can produce its counterfactual: "without this text, a
competent agent would do X — and neither the compiler, the tests, nor a reading of the code would
stop them", with X a concrete, plausible action. No nameable X, or an X the repo already catches:
skip the ADR. If X is scoped to a single code site, offer a code comment at that site instead.

Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md) — the counterfactual is the ADR's first
sentence, followed by the decision, its why, and the measurements that killed the alternatives,
never the implementation plan.
